# Notes App

Work-in-progress full-stack notes application with a Django REST API backend and a React frontend.

I’m using this project to get to grips with Django, so I’ve kept a detailed [developer log](DEVLOG.md) covering progress, issues I ran into, and how I resolved them. I am also adding to [NOTES.md](NOTES.md) with concepts and takeaways from the documentation.

Currently working on the React UI (adding the navigation bar and filtering).
